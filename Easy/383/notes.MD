Method
1) iterate through ransomnote
2) add key of rune to map and increment every riune found
3) iterate though magazine and decrement every found
4) if every element =< return true

Solution   
Method worked just needed to reverse part 4 as it's easier to exit once one part is false rather than checking it's constantly true.
